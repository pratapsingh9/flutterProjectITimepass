However, above all else, the staff and students of Mayoor were friendly, warm and welcoming. They ensured our first visit to India was defined by happy memories and I very much hope to return in the future. We were proud to have been the first of many students to undertake this internship and cement the relationship between Murray Edwards College and Mayoor School.””–Elizabeth Gould
